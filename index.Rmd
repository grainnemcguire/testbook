# Introduction {-}

This is experimental work on ways of displaying MLRWP content.
For the actual content itself, refer to https://institute-and-faculty-of-actuaries.github.io/mlr-blog/


* We are considering collating MLRWP posts into an online book so they are more easily located

* This is a prototype of how it might look


## Rendering book {-}

Can either use the preview book add-in or `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::gitbook')` to render on demand.



## Misc points {-}

* will need to use renv to ensure that this can be run - each time it is updated, it will need to be rebuilt.
